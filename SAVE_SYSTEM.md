# Save System Documentation

## Overview

The KittenGames save system allows users to backup and restore **all game data** for the entire site. This includes localStorage, cookies, and IndexedDB data for **all games** on the domain.

## Features

### ï¿½ **Site-Wide Save/Load**
- Saves all localStorage, cookies, and IndexedDB for the entire domain
- One save file contains progress for **all games** on the site
- Load restores data for **all games** at once

### ï¿½ **File Format**
- Files saved as `.kgsave` format
- Named as `allgames-{timestamp}.kgsave`
- Contains metadata and all site data

### ðŸ”„ **Complete Data Replacement**
- Loading a save file completely replaces all localStorage, cookies, and IndexedDB
- Clears existing data before restoring saved data
- Automatically reloads the page after restore

## Technical Implementation

### Components

1. **SaveLoadModal** - UI for save/load operations
2. **hotkeys-helper.js** - Handles data extraction/restoration in games
3. **HotkeysManager** - Manages communication between parent and iframe

### Data Flow

```
User clicks Save â†’ Modal opens â†’ Game iframe extracts all site data â†’ 
Data packaged into .kgsave file â†’ File downloaded

User uploads .kgsave â†’ Modal validates file â†’ Game iframe restores all data â†’ 
Page reloads with restored data
```

### File Structure

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "scope": "allgames",
    "timestamp": 1692185400000,
    "date": "2023-08-16T10:30:00.000Z",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
    "url": "https://site.com/play/game"
  },
  "gameData": {
    "localStorage": { /* all localStorage data */ },
    "cookies": { /* all cookies */ },
    "indexedDB": { /* all IndexedDB databases */ },
    "timestamp": 1692185400000,
    "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
    "url": "https://site.com/play/game"
  }
}
```

## Usage

### From Game Pages

1. **Click the Save button** in the compact header while playing any game
2. **Choose Save tab** in the modal
3. **Click Save** - downloads `allgames-{timestamp}.kgsave`

### Loading Saves

1. **Click the Save button** in the compact header
2. **Choose Load tab** in the modal  
3. **Upload a .kgsave file** - only accepts "allgames" scope files
4. **Data is restored** and page reloads automatically

## Benefits

### ðŸŽ® **Universal Backup**
- One file backs up progress from all games
- No need for per-game saves
- Simplified user experience

### ðŸ”’ **Complete Restoration**
- Preserves all game states exactly as they were
- Includes all storage mechanisms (localStorage, cookies, IndexedDB)
- Cross-game data compatibility

### ðŸ’» **Browser Compatibility**
- Works in all modern browsers
- Handles different storage mechanisms gracefully

## Technical Notes

### Storage Mechanisms

1. **localStorage** - Simple key-value storage, cleared and restored completely
2. **Cookies** - All site cookies extracted and restored with proper encoding  
3. **IndexedDB** - Complete database extraction including structure and data

### Security Considerations

- Save files contain all site data - treat as sensitive
- Validation ensures only compatible save files are loaded
- No external network requests during save/load operations

### Browser Limitations

- IndexedDB access requires same-origin policy compliance
- Some browsers may limit file download/upload operations
- Large save files may impact performance

## Error Handling

- **Invalid file format** - Clear error messages
- **Incompatible saves** - Checks for "allgames" scope
- **Storage errors** - Graceful fallbacks and user feedback
- **Timeout protection** - 10-second limits on operations

The save system provides a comprehensive backup solution for all game progress on the KittenGames site!
